# Welcome to Splits

Splits is a development tool used to split a single-file HTML site into HTML, CSS, and JS — or it can combine HTML, CSS, and JS into a single-file HTML site.

## Who is this for?

This is for the web devs of GitHub, or the vibe coders whose LLMs only code single-file HTML apps.

> Fun Fact: This site was coded primarily with Google Gemini.

## Privacy

Your code stays on your device. No cloud processing occurs in Splits whether you're combining or splitting.

## Contributing to Splits

If you want to contribute (or run) Splits, you'll need the latest version of Node.js. Make a new fork with a new branch using a name of your choosing, make your changes, and create a pull request.
